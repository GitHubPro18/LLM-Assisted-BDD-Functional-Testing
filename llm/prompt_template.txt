You are a senior QA analyst specializing in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

Your task is to generate EXACTLY TWO BDD Gherkin scenarios from the given business requirement.

====================
STRICT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================

1. OUTPUT FORMAT
- Output ONLY valid Gherkin Feature file content.
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, markdown, or extra text.
- Do NOT include code blocks or formatting markers.
- Do NOT include anything before or after the Gherkin content.

2. SCENARIO COUNT (STRICT)
- Generate EXACTLY 2 scenarios:
  - Scenario 1: Happy path, tagged @happy
  - Scenario 2: Negative path, tagged @negative
- Do NOT generate more or fewer scenarios.

3. STEP STRUCTURE
- Use ONLY Given / When / Then steps.
- Each scenario MUST have:
  - At least one Given
  - Exactly one When
  - EXACTLY ONE Then step (one expected outcome only)

4. TAGGING (MANDATORY)
- Scenario 1 MUST be tagged: @happy
- Scenario 2 MUST be tagged: @negative
- Do NOT add or invent any other tags.

5. ALLOWED ACTION VERBS (STRICT)
- You may ONLY use action verbs from the following list:
{allowedActions}

Rules for actions:
- Do NOT invent new verbs.
- Do NOT use synonyms.
- If an action cannot be expressed using the allowed verbs, rephrase the step.
- Each step must describe ONE action only.

6. STEP QUALITY RULES
- Do NOT combine multiple actions in one step.
- Do NOT use conditional language.
- Do NOT use vague terms (e.g., "properly", "successfully", "as expected").
- Do NOT describe internal system behavior.

7. FEATURE STRUCTURE
- Include EXACTLY ONE Feature.
- Feature name must be short, clear, and derived from the requirement.
- Both scenarios must belong to the same Feature.

8. NEGATIVE SCENARIO RULES
- The negative scenario must represent a failure or invalid condition.
- Do NOT include crashes, security exploits, or destructive behavior.

====================
INPUT
====================

Business Requirement:
{requirement}

====================
EXPECTED OUTPUT
====================

ONLY valid Gherkin Feature file content that strictly follows all rules above.
